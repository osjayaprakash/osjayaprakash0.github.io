1. There is a door we all want to walk through, and writing can help you find it and open it. Writing can give you what having a baby can give you: it can get you to start paying attention, can help you soften, can wake you up. But publishing won’t do any of those things; you’ll never get in that way.

#### FACING CHALLENGES

#### DECISION MAKING

1. Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that – they are changeable, reversible – they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups. -- *Jeff bezos*

#### HARD WORK

1. There may be people that have more talent than you, but there’s no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.
   
3. I start early, and I stay late, day after day after day, year after year. It took me 17 years and 114 days to become an overnight success.

4. Do not let **comfort** slow you down.

1. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. -- *Arthur C Clarke*

1. Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people's thinking. -- *Steve Jobs*
    
1. How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives. -- *Annie Dillard*

1. Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great. -- *Mark Twain*
   
1. However little television you watch, watch less. -- *David McCullough*

1. Successful people create companies.  More successful people create countries.  The most successful people create religions. -- *Qi Liu*
   
3. The real measure of your wealth is how much you’d be worth if you lost all your money.
   
5. Sometimes you're just happy playing. Some people, some media, unfortunately, don't understand that it's okay just to play tennis and enjoy it. They always think you have to win everything, it always needs to be a success story, and if it's not, obviously, what is the point? Maybe you have to go back and think, Why have I started playing tennis? Because I just like it. It's actually sort of a dream hobby that became somewhat of a job. Some people just don't get that, ever. -- *Federer*
