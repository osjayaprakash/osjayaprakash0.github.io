It is already end of this year. I am hoping for a fresh start in the year to come.

While I want to improve myself in lot of ways. There was a long-standing wish which I never gotten into. It is writing. I realized the importance of writing and hoping that I can write regularly in the years to come.

#### Writing Goals
  
  * One post per month
  * Limit the focus on the following topics:
    * Tech
    * Health & Fitness
    * Investment

#### Benefits of writing regularly

  * One of my mentor told me that "Speaking, Writing and Ideas" are important. In that order (Some argue writing should be first).
    * I took sometime to understand and process that. I was always jumping into activities (programming and coding), receiving feedbacks, etc. However I need admit that my effort on writing was lesser than other areas. This is the time to invest more on it.
  * Writing makes us better thinkers (not other way around). It clarifies our thinking. Thoughts and feelings can be put them in order with writing.
  * Improves communication (writing in particular)
  * Forces us to come up with new ideas regularly.

#### How
  
  * Write something. Do not overthink.
  * Not being perfectionist. Writing should improve if it is repeated regularly.
