My friend and I bicycled from South Bay Area to Los Angeles in 2017. This blog is summary of that 9 days bicycling experience.

#### WHY
 The bicycling over 9 days for 500KM is difficult. Especially when we're not regular bicyclists. I started bicycling in 2016. The reasoning was as follows:

 * Adventorous: I wanted to do something adventorous. Also, I was quite bored with bicycling around the South Bay area, and wanted to do something larger activity before stopping.
 * No alterative plans: I had no other vacations planned for 2017th summer.
 * Testing my optimism: I also wanted to test my physical and mental limitations. A lot of my friends were willing to bet that I wouldn't do (though they didn't bet unfortunately). I was optimistic that I can do it and at the same time I was curious to put my optimism to test.

 * Team: 
   * I felt that it is impossible to bicycle alone for so many days. I have asked friends and folks at work, and no one was interested (not surprising?). 
   * I was looking at public groups to find someone to ride with, and I got a reponse from someone from Los Angeles who wants to bike. He was excited, willing to South Bay and bicyle from South Bay to LA.
 * Preparation
   * I was riding bicycle for almost an year at this point. Daily commute is 10 miles; Bicycled regularly on weekend (each trip covered around 60 miles). 
   * I switched from a hybrid bike to road bike.
   * We have decided to keep things simple. Staying at hotel was better choice. We have considered camping which means carrying tent & equipments -- which seems difficult compared with staying at hotel which provided flexiblity.
 * Outcome
   * We have completed. It was fun to ride in different parts.
   * Not a single day went as per our plan. There were lot of uncertainities from road-closures (Google Map was not good), lost in the path (no network?), danger of riding in freeway shoulders (1000 ft elevation drop in freeway shoulders was the worst)
   * Having team with complementary skills is good. I was good with directions and friends was good with planning & logistics.
   * It is important not to give up. There were numerious times, we tempted to call our friends, pick us up, abandon the plan and get comfortable sleep at home.
   * I was completely sun burnt at the end of the trip. Riding in July Summer is simply roasting myself in oven.


#### Summary
 * On Day 1: We pedaled for 90 miles which was much higher than originally planned for 35 miles.
 * On Day 1: We had to bike in highway 101 at 9PM. It was pitch dark night.
 * On Day 2: We were confident that we could complete the trip.
 * On Day 2: We realized that Google Maps is not good. Most of trails lead us to private property (with a sign saying that trespassers will be prosecuted). We had to make difficult decisions, just trust our intutions, ride along freeway for sometime.
 * On Day 2: We ended up the trip early compared to first day fearing that riding in highway dangerous and uncertainity on which trail is closed or open.
 * On Day 3: We had to ride down over 1200 ft. Trust me it is difficult to control the bike in the downhill. It is much dangerous when the downhill is a freeway shoulder. We should never break, easy way to loose control and fall in the road.
 * On Day 4: It was independence day. A lot of cars on the road. It seems like they were annoyed seeing two people on cycles. We were constantly honked.
 * On Day 5: This is the most peaceful day. 1st day went as per our plan.
 * On Day 6: We reached close to Highway 1 and riding along the coastal shore had great view.
 * On Day 7: Back to civilization. Santa Monica beach. Nice views.
 * On Day 8: Ride to LA
 * On Day 9: Fly back to San Francisco.
