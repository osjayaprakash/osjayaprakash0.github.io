My friend and I bicycled from South Bay Area to Los Angeles in 2017. This blog is summary of that 9 days bicycling experience.

#### WHY
 The bicycling over 9 days for 500KM is difficult. Especially when we're not regular bicyclists. I started bicycling in 2016. The reasoning was as follows:

 * Adventorous: I wanted to do something adventorous. Also, I was quite bored with bicycling around the South Bay area, and wanted to do something larger activity before stopping.
 * No alterative plans: I had no other vacations planned for 2017th summer.
 * Testing my optimism: I also wanted to test my physical and mental limitations. A lot of my friends were willing to bet that I wouldn't do (though they didn't bet unfortunately). I was optimistic that I can do it and at the same time I was curious to put my optimism to test.

#### HOW

 * Team: 
   * I felt that it is impossible to bicycle alone for so many days. I have asked friends and folks at work, and no one was interested (not surprising?). 
   * I was looking at public groups to find someone to ride with, and I got a reponse from someone from Los Angeles who wants to bike. He was excited, willing to South Bay and bicyle from South Bay to LA.
 * Preparation
   * I was riding bicycle for almost an year at this point. Daily commute is 10 miles; Bicycled regularly on weekend (each trip covered around 60 miles). 
   * I switched from a hybrid bike to road bike.
   * We have decided to keep things simple. Staying at hotel was better choice. We have considered camping which means carrying tent & equipments -- which seems difficult compared with staying at hotel which provided flexiblity.
 * Outcome
   * We have completed. It was fun to ride in different parts.
   * Not a single day went as per our plan. There were lot of uncertainities from road-closures (Google Map was not good), lost in the path (no network?), danger of riding in freeway shoulders (1000 ft elevation drop in freeway shoulders was the worst)
   * Having team with complementary skills is good. I was good with directions and friends was good with planning & logistics.
   * It is important not to give up. There were numerious times, we tempted to call our friends, pick us up, abandon the plan and get comfortable sleep at home.
   * I was completely sun burnt at the end of the trip. Riding in July Summer is simply roasting myself in oven.


#### Day 1 (88 miles, 12 hours, 800 ft):
 * Day 1 was started from Santa Cruz. Our friends had dropped us in Santa Cruz in the early morning. 
 * We had a breakfast and coffee from a small restaraunt there. We took a customary photo before the first petal, and we started to petal in Santa Cruz down. Santa Cruz neighbourhood roads are slopy. I felt too much pain in the legs in first 30 mins into it. 
 * Biking through strawberry fields was great with nice smell. It also created craving for food.
 * The final stretch was bit difficult part of the day. We had to ride along the 101 freewway shoulders, at 9PM in the pitch dark. 
 * We planned to bike for 40 miles in first day, however after lunch, we pushed for 88 miles.

#### Day 2

  * We were more confident on the second day. We have tried to keep the distance smaller compared to first day.
  * First half of the day was riding in a desert. No mobile signals. We had to rely on our intuition for direction.
  * We had stopped for Lunch in a small town. Then tooks nap outside the restaurant. The had benches outside, we just slep in there for an hour. Getting sleep was easy with all the pedalling.
